# Django API Views with Django Rest Frameworks

## Lesson

So far we've created Pokemon and Moves utilizing Django-ORM with associations, validators, and tests. Although it's been great we still haven't talked about why we are utilizing Django-ORM to interact with our database. Django is a powerful Back-End framework that we will utilize to host our Application Programming Interface for our Full-Stack-Applications. Today we are going to begin creating `views` to interact with our models and return the data we desire.

## Things to consider when creating our API Views

1. Using JSON format for sending and receiving data.
    - This is becuase most Frameworks now a days Front-End or Back-end have built in methods to be able to effectively utilize JSON data. JSON was specifically made to interact with JavaScript and is therefor easily interpreted by JavaScript. Python has a built in method like json.loads() to grab the JSON data in the body of a request and turn it into something Python can utilize.
2. Use Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination to Retrieve the Data Requested.
    -   Databases can get very large and complicated so it's important to only grab the neccessary data from our database and sort it to create consistency in our API responses.

## Creating our first API views

To create our API views we will utilize [django-rest-frameworks](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) to interact with our requests and deliver effective responses.

Lets install [django-rest-frameworks](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) and go into pokemon_app/views.py to create our API view.

```bash
    # Install Django Rest Frameworks
    pip install djangorestframework
    # add it to requirements.txt
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

First lets create a view that will get all of our existing pokemon. Here's an example of what we would expect it to look:

```js
[
    {
        "model": "pokemon_app.pokemon",
        "pk": 1,
        "fields": {
            "name": "Pikachu",
            "level": 12,
            "date_encountered": "2008-01-01",
            "date_captured": "2023-04-14T05:16:41.794Z",
            "description": "Unkown",
            "captured": true,
            "moves": [
                1
            ]
        }
    },
    {
        "model": "pokemon_app.pokemon",
        "pk": 2,
        "fields": {
            "name": "Charizard",
            "level": 25,
            "date_encountered": "2007-04-07",
            "date_captured": "2023-04-14T05:17:16.178Z",
            "description": "Unkown",
            "captured": true,
            "moves": []
        }
    },
    {
        "model": "pokemon_app.pokemon",
        "pk": 3,
        "fields": {
            "name": "Blastoise",
            "level": 37,
            "date_encountered": "2008-01-01",
            "date_captured": "2023-04-14T05:26:47.309Z",
            "description": "Unkown",
            "captured": false,
            "moves": []
        }
    }
]
```
Lets create our view

```python 
# pokemon_app/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
# We will import the following to read and return JSON data more efficiently
from rest_framework.views import APIView, Response
# We want to bring in our model
from .models import Pokemon
# We will utilize serializer to turn our QuerySets into 
# binary string
from django.core.serializers import serialize
# Json.loads will turn binary strings into JSON data
import json

# Create your views here.
class All_pokemon(APIView):
    # Establish the method that will trigger this behavior
    def get(self, request):
        # Grab all Pokemon existing within our database in a
        # specific order to keep consistency. In this case
        # we will order our data by name in aphabetical order
        pokemon = Pokemon.objects.all().order_by('name')
        # we can't send back query sets as a valid JSON response
        # so we will utilize Django's built in serialize function
        # to turn our query set into a binary string
        serialized_pokemon = serialize('json', pokemon)
        # Now we can use the python json.loads function to turn 
        # our binary string into a workable json format
        json_pokemon = json.loads(serialized_pokemon)
        return Response(json_pokemon)
```

Now we can move onto our urls and create our endpoints that will trigger this view we created

```python 
from django.contrib import admin
# import include to access different apps urls.py
from django.urls import path, include

# enpoints should be nouns and pluralized
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    # now we can interact with pokemon_app urls
    path('api/v1/pokemon/', include("pokemon_app.urls")),
]
```

We are telling our project to include pokemon_app/urls.py but currently there is no urls.py file in our pokemon_app. Lets make one and add an empty url enpoint.

```python
# pokemon_app/urls.py

from django.urls import path
# Explicit imports
from .views import All_pokemon
# Remember all urls are prefaced by http://localhost:8000/api/v1/pokemon/
urlpatterns = [
    # Currently only takes GET requests
    path('', All_pokemon.as_view(), name='all_pokemon')
]
```


Now that we are done with pokemon_app lets move on to Moves and grab all moves currently created.

```js
[
    {
        "model": "move_app.move",
        "pk": 1,
        "fields": {
            "name": "Psychic",
            "accuracy": 70,
            "maxPP": 20,
            "pp": 20,
            "power": 80
        }
    }
]
```

Lets create our view to grab all moves

```python 
# pokemon_app/views.py l
from django.shortcuts import render
# We will import the following to read and return JSON data more efficiently
from rest_framework.views import APIView, Response
# We want to bring in our model
from .models import Move
# serialize will turn querysets into binary string
from django.core.serializers import serialize
# Json will turn binary string into JSON readable data
import json

# Create your views here.
class All_moves(APIView):
    # specify which request method should trigger this behavior
    def get(self, request):
        # grab a binary string of all Moves in the DB ordered by name
        moves = serialize('json', Move.objects.all().order_by('name'))
        # utilize json.loads to turn moves into JSON Data
        moves = json.loads(moves)
        return Response(moves)
```

Then add move_app/urls.py to our projects urls

```python
from django.contrib import admin
# import include to access different apps urls.py
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('api/v1/pokemon/', include("pokemon_app.urls")),
    # include move_app urls.py file
    path('api/v1/moves/', include("move_app.urls")),
]
```

And finally lets link our move_app/urls.py with our view

```python
# students_app/urls.py

from django.urls import path
# Import All_
from .views import All_moves

# remember all urls are prefaced by http://localhost:8000/api/v1/moves/
urlpatterns = [
    path('', All_moves.as_view(), name='all_views')
]
```

## Intro to Postman

**What is Postman?** Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIsâ€”faster


We can utilize Postman to test our api and send `GET` request to the current urls we've established. First we must run the server to ensure our information is accessible through local host.

```bash
    python manage.py runserver
```

Now in Postman send GET requests to the following url paths:

```http
 http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/pokemon/
 http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/moves/
```
